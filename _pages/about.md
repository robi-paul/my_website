I am an Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Engineering at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). My research focus on enhancing hardware security for machine learning models through innovative Side Channel Analysis (SCA) techniques. My work leverages power analysis not only to detect potential violations in ML models but also to identify adversarial examples by monitoring power consumption patterns. I received my BSc in Electrical Engineering from the Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, Sylhet, Bangladesh in 2022.
